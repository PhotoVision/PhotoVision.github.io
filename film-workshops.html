                <h3>July 10–11, 2018 | Seattle, Washington</h3>
                <p><i>Belle Lumère is beyond excited to bring you an amazing opportunity in 2018 to not only immerse yourself in film, but to also be a 
                    part of a community and re-inspire yourself as an artist. We want to go back to "simple." Back to creating an event that is more about 
                    education, simplicity and community. We understand film is a journey. It’s not a short trip where you can learn everything you need to 
                    know in a single day. As a film photographer, you are always growing and evolving. You always have questions and the urge to hear 
                    opinions on your work. This is why for all our 2018 events, the actual workshop does not end after everyone goes home. No, the group 
                    and community that we create during our two days will continue on in a private group set up just for our attendees for each individual 
                    event. This way questions can be asked, images can be shared and you will have a support group behind you for your film journey. Head 
                    on over to our <a href="http://www.bellelumieremagazine.com/seattle-2018/">workshops page</a> to learn more!</i></p>
