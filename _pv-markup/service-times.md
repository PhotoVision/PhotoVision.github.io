# Service Times

_Service times are in business days starting the first business day **after** your order is received and are given as **good faith estimates**. Our service times tend to increase in Summer and Fall (i.e. wedding season) and decrease in Winter. Service times are ultimately dependent on the volume of work coming in from our photographers and may fluctuate while your film is in lab._
## Current film process + scan service time is: **{{ site.turnaround-time }}**. _Updated {{ site.time | date: '%B %-d' }}_.

## Current print service times are: **1 business day** for 12x18 and smaller (<200), and **3 business days** for 16x20â€“30x45.

## Current proof print service times are: **{{ site.turnaround-time }} + 1 day** (Updated {{ site.time | date: '%m-%d-%y' }}).
