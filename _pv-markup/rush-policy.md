# Rush Policy

High-quality scans + speedy turnarounds are our jam. We are pleased to offer rush processing when our [film service times]({{ site.baseurl}}/service-times) exceed a photographer's urgent time frame. All rush orders subject to lab availability. Turnaround times are in business days **starting the first business day after** your order is received. To maintain consistency, partial job rushes are unavailable. To request a rush, please make a note under Special Instructions on your <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/images/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form-Dec-2017.pdf" target="_blank">order form</a> and note the applicable charge below, based on date of request:
