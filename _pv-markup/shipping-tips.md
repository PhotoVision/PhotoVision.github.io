# Shipping Tips

<div class="panel" markdown="1">
### Use a zip-close bag
Liquids are surprisingly harmful to unprocessed film. Placing your film + [online order]({{ site.baseurl }}/order-work) code or [printed order form]({{site.baseurl}}/images/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form.pdf){: target="_blank"} inside a plastic zip-close bag gives you added peace of mind and protects your investment.

### Use a box + plenty of cushioning
We've seen more than one roll of film lost into the postal abyss because it was sent in a flimsy envelope. *Don't be that guy!* &nbsp;Place your bagged film + [online order]({{ site.baseurl }}/order-work) code or [printed order form]({{site.baseurl}}/images/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form.pdf){: target="_blank"} inside a box and use plenty of cushioning to ensure your film's safe arrival. (Pro tip: [USPS Priority Mail boxes](http://store.usps.com/store/results/free-shipping-supplies/shipping-supplies/_/N-alnx4jZ7d0v8v) are free!)

### Get a tracking number
We _highly recommend_ you send your film via a trackable method. Your film is precious cargo! Generally, we have found USPS Priority Mail to be the most economical choice.

### Sending in more than one shoot?
Not a problem! Please fill out *one order form per shoot* (whether [ordering online]({{ site.baseurl }}/order-work) or using a [printed order form]({{site.baseurl}}/images/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form.pdf){: target="_blank"}). Each order's film and [online order]({{ site.baseurl }}/order-work) code or [printed order form]({{site.baseurl}}/images/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form.pdf){: target="_blank"} should be placed in separate zip-close bags.

### Do you accept weekend deliveries?
We do not accept deliveries on Saturday or Sunday. Orders that arrive on Saturday and Sunday will either be kept safe in a drop box until Monday or, if a signature is required, be delivered to us Monday.
