# Shipping Tips

## Use a zip-close bag
Liquids are surprisingly harmful to unprocessed film. Placing your film + [online order code]({{ site.baseurl/order-work }})] or <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/images/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form-Dec-2017.pdf" target="_blank">printed order form</a> inside a plastic zip-close bag gives you added peace of mind and protects your investment.

## Use a box + plenty of cushioning
We've seen more than one roll of film lost into the postal abyss because it was sent in a flimsy envelope. *Don't be that guy!* Place your bagged film + [online order code]({{ site.baseurl/order-work }})] or <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/images/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form-Dec-2017.pdf" target="_blank">printed order form</a> inside a box and use plenty of cushioning to ensure your film's safe arrival. (Pro tip: [USPS Priority Mail boxes](http://store.usps.com/store/results/free-shipping-supplies/shipping-supplies/_/N-alnx4jZ7d0v8v) are free!)

## Get a tracking number
We _highly recommend_ you send your film via a trackable method. Your film is precious cargo! Generally, we have found USPS Priority Mail to be the most economical choice. 

## Sending in more than one shoot?
Not a problem! Please fill out *one order form per shoot* (whether [online]({{ site.baseurl/order-work }}) or <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/images/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form-Dec-2017.pdf" target="_blank">download + print</a>) and separate each shoot + order code or <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/images/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form-Dec-2017.pdf" target="_blank">printed order form</a> into their own zip-close bag.

## Where do I send my film?
Download our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/images/PhotoVision+Mailing+Label.pdf" target="_blank">pre-addressed shipping label</a> or hand-address your package in stunning calligraphy to:  
**Attn: Film Crew**  
**PhotoVision**  
**3775 Market St NE**  
**Salem OR 97301**
