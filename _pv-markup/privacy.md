 Your personal information, images and film will only be used for their intended purposes, described below:

### Email Address

### Credit Card Information

We’ll charge out print orders, film purchase orders and process + scan orders. 

### Address

Used to ship film purchase orders, print orders and processed negatives home to you. 

### Preference Images

## You have a right to be forgotten.

We love working with all our photographers and truly enjoy being a part of your team. However, if you feel at any point we are not the right fit, you have the right to request all your personal information and imagery be removed from our database.

We are so thankful for your work. Thank you for trusting us with your beautiful imagery.
