# The Strengths of the Frontier SP3000 and Noritsu S-1800
Both film scanners are excellent tools to help you reach your vision. As you weigh the aesthetics + benefits of each, keep the following in mind:
  
## Your exposures + your preferences will *always* matter more than the scanner you choose.

How you shoot your film and the reference images you provide do so much more to carry your vision than choosing the “right film scanner.” With that in mind, here are a few key differences between the Frontier SP3000 and the Noritsu S-1800:

### Contrast
The Noritsu has 100% more control over contrast than the Frontier. Shadows + highlights can also be controlled independently, so you could simultaneously lighten the shadows and darken the highlights if you so choose. Considering the substantial control over contrast, it’s easy to why the Noritsu excels when it comes to black + white film. 

### Color Signatures
The Frontier tends toward a more natural color palette, while the Noritsu can occasionally exhibit more vibrant greens. Keep in mind that color qualities you find in the Frontier can largely be produced on the Noritsu.

### Larger Files + Faster Service Times
Newer technology like the Noritsu S-1800 means faster scans, and faster scans mean faster service times. What’s more, the Noritsu also provides larger scan sizes than the Frontier, making Noritsu scans a great value!

### Which is Better?
There are so many variables between the Frontier and Noritsu that a 1:1 comparison isn’t very helpful. Rather, it really comes down to your eye and what you prefer. 

### Take Both for a Spin
You never know which scanner you may prefer until you see scans from each. While we do not split a single order between two scanners, we are happy to scan two separate test orders so you can try both!
