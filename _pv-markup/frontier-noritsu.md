# The Strengths of the Frontier SP3000 + Noritsu S-1800
Both film scanners are excellent tools to help you reach your vision. As you weigh the aesthetics + benefits of each, keep the following in mind:

## How you shoot your film + the preferences you provide to us will *always* matter more than choosing the “right film scanner.”

With that in mind, here are a few key differences between the Frontier SP3000 and the Noritsu S-1800:

## Contrast
The Noritsu has significant more control over contrast than the Frontier. Shadows + highlights can be controlled independently, so you could simultaneously lighten the shadows and darken the highlights if needed. Considering the substantial control over contrast, it’s easy to see why the Noritsu excels when it comes to black + white film.

## Grain
Noritsu scans carry a finer grain appearance when viewed in close detail, even *without* sharpening added, when compared to Frontier large scans.

## Color Signatures
The Frontier tends toward a more natural color palette, while the Noritsu can occasionally exhibit more vibrant greens and deeper reds, while holding onto purples. Keep in mind that color qualities you find in the Frontier can largely be produced on the Noritsu.

## Larger Files + Faster Service Times
Newer technology like the Noritsu S-1800 means faster scans, and faster scans mean faster service times. What’s more, the Noritsu also provides larger scan sizes standard than the Frontier’s normal size, making Noritsu scans a great value!

## Take Both for a Spin
Send us a single roll with “Noritsu Frontier Test” as the shoot name and we’ll scan it on both so you can see the results first-hand. (We will only charge you for 1 roll of normal process + scan.)
