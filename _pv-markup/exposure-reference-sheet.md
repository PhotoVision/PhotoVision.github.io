# Exposure Reference Sheets

## What are they?
When shooting film, your negatives act as your road map to understanding the connection between how you expose your film and your scan results. Exposure Reference Sheets are provided for every roll within your order's [Box](http://box.com) folder. They are designed to help you better understand the relationship between your exposures and scans at a glance.

## How do I read them?
Exposure Reference Sheets provide a thumbnail of every frame in your roll, allowing you to clearly and easily see how you exposed your film. Frames that are light with little detail represent overexposure, while frames that are dark with lots of detail represent underexposure.
