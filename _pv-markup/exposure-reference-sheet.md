# Exposure Reference Sheets

When shooting film, your negatives act as your road map to understanding the relationship between your exposures + scans.

## An exclusive feature designed by us 

Learning how to read your exposures is vital to understanding your scans. Our Exposure Reference Sheeets are an easy-to-use tool uploaded alongside your scans. They provide a thumbnail of each frame, helping you quickly + easily decipher your scans right away. Pretty cool, huh?

## How do I read my Exposure Reference Sheet?  

Frames within your Exposure Reference Sheet that appear dark represent underexposure, while frames that appear light represent overexposure. Our one-of-a-kind Exposure Reference Sheets tell you what you need to know about your shooting, whether you need to make changes in your exposures or if you’re on the right track. They will help you understand your results—for every single frame—and allow you to see any exposure shifts that may be occurring within your film. 

The images within this Exposure Reference Sheet below show a variety of exposures in 1 stop increments. These exposure shifts can be seen in the levels of density within each frame:
