# A feature designed to close the gap between exposures + scans  

When shooting film, your negatives act as your road map to understanding the connection between how you expose your film and your scan results. Our goal is to provide a tool to help you better understand your exposures + scans at a glance.  

## Introducing, the Exposure Reference Sheet!  

Exposure Reference Sheets provide a thumbnail of each frame, allowing you to clearly + easily see how you exposed your film. Pretty cool, huh? The images within this Exposure Reference Sheet show a variety of exposures in 1 stop increments. These exposure shifts can be seen in the levels of density within each frame below:

## How do I read my Exposure Reference Sheet?  

Frames within your Exposure Reference Sheet that appear dark represent underexposure, while frames that appear light represent overexposure.  

Exposure Reference Sheets tell you what you need to know about your shooting, whether you need to make changes in your exposures or if you’re on the right track. They will help you understand your results—for every single frame—and allow you to see any exposure shifts that may be occurring within your film. 

## Where do I find them?  

Exposure Reference Sheets are provided for every roll in every job. They can be found within your order’s [Box](http://box.com){: target="_blank"} folder.
