We currently process C-41 color negative and Black + White negative film. We process most film sizes ranging from 135 roll film to 8x10 sheet film. You can find our current service time [here]({{ site.baseurl}}/service-times).

Sometimes you only need the bare essentials. When that's the case, your film will be developed with the utmost care before being sleeved and returned home to you.

## Develop + Scan
We scan all film on the highly sought-after Fuji Frontier SP3000 and the Noritsu S-1800. Both are excellent tools to help you reach your vision! You may choose between either on your <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/images/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form-Dec-2017.pdf" target="_blank">order form</a>. However, keep in mind there are certain film stocks that will always be scanned on the Noritsu: Portra160, Ektar100 and all black + white stocks. All scans are delivered via [Box](http://box.com), a simple online file sharing system that keeps all your orders organized!
