# We never gave up on the magic of Film

## We process C-41 color negative and Black + White film in most sizes ranging from 135 roll film to 8x10 sheet film. 
You can find our current service times [here]({{ site.baseurl}}/service-times). All scans are delivered via [Box](http://box.com){: target="_blank"}, a simple online file sharing system that keeps all your orders organized.


## Develop + Scan

Every roll of film is scanned by hand on the renowned Fuji Frontier SP3000 or state-of-the-art Noritsu S-1800. Both are excellent tools to help you reach your vision. You may choose between either on your [online]({{ site.baseurl }}/order-work) or [printed]({{site.baseurl}}/images/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form.pdf){: target="_blank"} order form. Keep in mind, you may only choose *one scanner per order*. If you do not specify, we will scan your order on the Frontier. All black + white scans from either scanner arrive as fully desaturated RGB images, exhibiting truly neutral tones.
