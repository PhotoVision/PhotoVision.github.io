# Film Services

We currently process C-41 color negative and Black + White negative film in most sizes ranging from 135 roll film to 8x10 sheet film. You can find our current service time [here]({{ site.baseurl}}/service-times).


## Develop + Scan
We scan all film on the highly sought-after Fuji Frontier SP3000 or state of the art Noritsu S-1800. Both are excellent tools to help you reach your vision! You may choose between either on your <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/images/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form-Dec-2017.pdf" target="_blank">order form</a>. If you do not specify, we will assume you want Frontier. However, keep in mind there are certain film stocks that will *always* be scanned on Noritsu: Portra160, Ektar100 and all black + white stocks. All scans are delivered via <a href="http://box.com" target="_blank">Box</a>, a simple online file sharing system that keeps all your orders organized!

## How do I get my negatives back?
We will hold your negatives based on the Ship Back preference marked on your <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/images/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form-Dec-2017.pdf" target="_blank">order form</a>.
