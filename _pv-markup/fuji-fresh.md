## What is gray market film?
Gray market film is film that has taken a worldwide journey before it makes its way to your camera. While that sounds like an awesome vacation, when it comes to film? Not so cool. If you don't know your film's history, you can't guarantee its quality.

## What are some signs of gray market film?
You may have gray market film if your scans have unexplained heat fog that looks like X-ray damage or shadows that appear underexposed even though you overexposed them.

## Don't risk it
While gray market film can exhibit no ill effects in your final images, we sadly have seen one too many sessions ruined by the simple fact our photogs did not know they were shooting gray market film. So we decided to do something about it.
