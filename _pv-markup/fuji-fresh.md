## We have sadly seen one too many sessions ruined by the simple fact our photogs did not know they were shooting gray market film.  

### What is gray market film? 
Gray market film is film that has taken a worldwide journey before it makes its way to your camera. While that sounds like an awesome vacation, when it comes to film? Not so cool. 

### If you don’t know your film’s history, you can’t guarantee its quality or performance.
Gray market film is too often stored in dubious conditions on its global journey—whether it suffers through high heat and/or humidity in a warehouse or sits on a loading dock in the sun for days. Such drastically different temperatures can dramatically impair a film's quality + performance.

### Who sells gray market film?
Some retailers don’t mention their film is gray market. Others do, and claim there is no difference. *We disagree*. Gray market film is inherently risky. Since there is no guarantee how the film was handled or stored, there is no guarantee how it will perform.

### What are some signs of gray market film?
You may have gray market film if your scans have unexplained heat fog that looks like X-ray damage or shadows that appear underexposed even though you overexposed them. Another sign is if you live in the US market and your film has foreign languages on the packaging—film intended for sale in the US will only have English on the package.

### Don’t risk it
While at first blush, gray market film seems like a great deal (*"I’m getting my favorite stock for cheap!"*) it simply isn’t worth the risk. The only way to guarantee consistent, quality film is to purchase it through a reliable source.

_**We want to ensure our photographers are getting the best film they can. So we decided to do something about it.**_
