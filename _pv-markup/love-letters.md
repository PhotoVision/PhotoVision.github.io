# Love Letters from Our Photographers

*Other labs don’t hold a candle to you in quality and care for their customers. Thanks for all you do!  
__[Kathryn Bruns](http://www.kathrynbruns.com/) December 15, 2017__*

*I love my scans from you guys and am confident that you’ll assist me with getting 'the look.' I’ve been bouncing around from labs testing but I love your turnaround time the most and how easy y’all are to work with!  
__[Justin Douglas](http://justindouglasphotos.com/) December 11, 2017__*

*I also want to thank you guys for being so awesome. [Katie De Lorme](http://www.katiedelorme.com/) talked you up, she's actually the reason I started using you guys. The scans and overall experience are the best I've had with a film lab. Thank you again!  
__[Keith Daigle](http://www.keithdaiglephotography.com/) December 8, 2017__*

*Thank you so much!! We are obsessed with our scans!!! We love them!! Thanks for all you guys do!  
__[Ally and Bobby Willix](http://allyandbobby.com/) November 21, 2017__*

*I just wanted to pop over really quick and say the rush [scans] I just received were AMAZING!!!!!! The colors were perfect!!! We are really getting the tones and my coloring preferences adjusted just right and I've been very happy with my recent scans!! Thank you for working with me on this over the past month!  
__[Ashley (McKinney) Brown of Shining Light Photography](http://shininglight516.com/) November 2, 2017__*

*A BIG thanks to everyone there working on my film, I couldn't do this without y'all, and I am so grateful!! XO

*Y’all—these scans are BEAUTIFUL. Thank you!!!!! Exactly what I was picturing as I was shooting them. Brava!  
__[Perry Vaile](http://perryvaile.com/) October 9, 2017__*

*Aloha, PhotoVision Team! I cannot thank you enough for your help! I really appreciate the extra attention and guidance you've given me. There was a lot of uncertainty on my end on how this order would turn out. When I got my scans, I was thrilled to see that they looked great! Though I'm currently a hobbyist photographer, I still felt like you rolled out the red carpet for me. Thanks for playing a pivotal roll in my passion for photography. Thank you for being awesome teachers. Thank you for the 5-star++++ customer service and the stellar job! Is it too weird to say 'I love you guys!?' Mahalo.  
__[Irene Cole](http://www.irenecolephotography.com/) September 28, 2017__*

*You guys are beyond amazing. THANK YOU for supporting us little people, thank you for thinking outside the box and thank you for doing what you do so well so we can do what we love doing! Sending you a virtual hug . . . and a box of chocolates. :wink:*  
*__[Betsy Tomasello of Betsy Blue Photography](http://www.betsyblue.com/) September 14, 2017__*

*Hello, PV Team! I just wanted to let you know how thrilled I am with these recent scans. You folks nailed it and I'm so grateful to have a quality lab I can trust with my business! Thank you!!  
__[Kathryn Bruns](http://www.kathrynbruns.com/) August 31, 2017__*

*Oh my god. You guys are incredible!! Every batch I send is more perfect than the last and these are no exception. I am blown away! Thank you for always making my work look amazing and giving such fabulous consistency. Love you all!  
__[Emily Sleadd of Hunting Ground Films](http://www.huntinggroundfilms.com/) August 31, 2017__*

*Hi there! First off, thank you SO much for letting me and my family drop in a couple of weeks ago on our way back to California at the tail end of our West Coast road trip. It was a major highlight for me, and I was just incredibly touched by how warm and gracious everyone was. The experience made me even more grateful for the entire PhotoVision Team and all the hard work you do. The fact that people recognized my two little girls from years' worth of scanning was the cherry on top. And getting to drop off my 4-year-old's first roll of film was what I hope will be the beginning of a long relationship between my daughter and PhotoVision. :slightly_smiling_face: Thank you so much for your time! I sure appreciate how easy it is to ask for help and advice from the Team at PhotoVision. Right from the get go, I have never once felt intimidated and that approachability sold me immediately!  
__[Jamie Fenwick of Jaime Lauren Photography](http://www.jaimelaurenphotography.com/) August 21, 2017__*

*Thanks for everything you guys do. You honestly have made my life as a photographer so much better!  
__[Cameo Godinho of Magnolia & Magpie](http://www.magnoliaandmagpie.com/) August 14, 2017)__*

*I always have such an incredible experience working with you guys and truly feel the love and care you put into developing the hundreds of rolls of film we all send you.  
__[Ali Lavin](http://alimaephoto.com/) August 7, 2017__*

*Hey, Team!! These two wedding could not be any more different lighting-wise, but you guys just 100% NAILED the skin tones on both of these, I could not be happier!!! . . . I just love how every note or comment I have made has been received and then applied to the next order. . . . Tears of joy. I love you guys!  
__[Matoli Keely](http://www.matolikeelyphotography.com/) July 26, 2017__*

*Thank you so much for such beautiful scans yet again! . . . Seeing these wonderful scans has been the silver lining in an otherwise stressful week. Thank you, thank you!  
__[Cassie Xie](http://www.cassiexie.com/) July 25, 2017__*

*Thank you once again for these scans. They are so amazing and I'm very pleased with this order. I know you guys are really busy with wedding season in full swing. I just wanted to extend how much I value what the Team provides. Keep up the great work!  
__[Shirley Matz](http://www.shirleyclairephotography.com/) July 20, 2017__*

*I want to say thank you for the first set of prints. They came out lovely and I really like the thickness of the paper. I will definitely be ordering more from you in the future!!  
__[Allyne Armitage](http://www.allynearmitage.com/) July 4, 2017__*

*Hi there, beautiful PhotoVision Team! I wanted to reach out quickly and share some exciting news with you all—I’m currently a finalist for Southern Weddings’ Best of the South Wedding Awards: Film Photographer. YAY! I owe you all a million thanks. I never could have gotten to this point without the gorgeous, consistent scans you provide and the care you give my film. Thank you, thank you, thank you. PV film crew, I could sing your praises all day—I love working with your amazing Team, and I’m deeply appreciative of all your hard work! Have a great day! :slightly_smiling_face:  
__[Haley Entrekin Bilunas of Photos by Heart](http://photosbyheart.com/) May 30, 2017__*

*I just wanted to say, over the past few years, I had a vision of where I wanted to be with my work and style. Step One was transitioning to film. The rest has been a learning process with myself, this new medium and understanding this craft. And over this process, you all have been nothing but helpful. I am so thankful for everything you do and so happy with where my style has evolved to this day!! I couldn’t do it without you guys.  
__[Kelsea Holder](http://www.kelseaholder.com/) May 19, 2017__*

*You guys KILLED it on [these] scans! I was so thrilled with how the photos turned out, and thankful for clients who are willing to trust my instincts, and for a lab [who] delivers quality time and time again.  
__[Jen Dillender](http://www.jendillenderphotography.com/) July 28, 2017__*

*Thank you, thank you, thank you for ALWAYS exceeding my expectations! What an amazing way to kick off 2017 wedding season! Love you guys! The color and tones exactly on point—perfect scans! :slightly_smiling_face:  
__[Alexandra Elise](http://www.alexandraelisephotography.com/) May 18, 2017__*

*Thanks, y'all! You're always so awesome and make our pictures look like magic!  
__[Cameo Godinho of Magnolia & Magpie](http://www.magnoliaandmagpie.com/) May 11, 2017__*

*Thank you so much. I can't tell you guys how much I appreciate all that you do for me and my business. I love working with your Team and LOVE my scans from your company! Happy to say that I've been with you guys over a year now!  
__[Shauna Veasey](http://www.shaunaveaseyphotography.com/) May 8, 2017__*

*To the amazing-wonderful-incredible Team at PhotoVision, I have to send you a quick note telling you THANK YOU for all of the amazing work that you do! I truly teared up when I saw these last night, it was absolutely wonderful. This was such a special project for me. When I got asked by the planner to be a part of this shoot, I was incredibly nervous. I know so many film photographers do destination styled shoots on a regular basis, but this was my first one and I was freaking out! So seeing these and seeing how it all came together truly humbled me. Again, I know you get insanely beautiful styled shoots to develop and scan daily, and for my first destination styled shoot, I truly thank you guys for your amazing talent. I am forever grateful!  
__[Jessica Blass of Jessica Gold Photography](http://www.jessicagoldphotography.com/) May 5, 2017__*

*I shot this session LAST WEEK—LITERALLY LAST FRIDAY—and these DLKFJS:LKMCSD:LJDS SCANS ARE IN MY HANDS ALREADY. AND THEY ARE AMAZING. I cannot begin to thank you guys! OH MY GOODNESS. This is the pinnacle of all that I've ever dreamed of in a creative shoot and I was SO. FLIPPING. WORRIED about shooting in this indoor studio with barely any daylight and you guys have completely blown me away with the color work here. I'm seriously in tears. I can't stop looking at these photos. Thank you, thank you, thank you! I cannot WAIT to share these with my partners. Thank you a million times over and more!  
__[Cassie Xie](http://www.cassiexie.com/) May 4, 2017__*

*ARE YOU GUYS SERIOUS?!?!?! First off, you turn 2 weddings and a rehearsal (over 150 rolls) around in 1 day. THEN, I look at the scans are they are unbelievable! Insanely consistent and just absolutely nailed on all accounts. I don't know how you're doing it, but keep doing it. Thank you so much for everything! I truly couldn't be happier. I love you and I'm not afraid to say it.  
__[Erich McVey](http://www.erichmcvey.com/) April 27, 2017__*

*Oh my goodness! Y’all are amazing! I’m in love with these scans! Thank you so much for the speedy turnaround and for doing such a wonderful job! :slightly_smiling_face:  
__[Courtney Leigh](http://courtneyleighphoto.com/) April 27, 2017__*

*Y'AAAAALLLLLL. I am losing my MIND, these are EXACTLY what I pictured in my head! Thank you, thank you, thank youuuuuu! So much fun to relive this trip!!!  
__[Perry Vaile](http://perryvaile.com/) April 25, 2017__*

*Absolutely smashed it! Knocked it out of the park as usual! Thank you so much!  
__[Abigail Malone](http://www.abigailmalone.com/) April 25, 2017__*

*Dear PhotoVision Team, I couldn't be more happy with how these scans came out! Thank you so, so much for doing such an incredible job on my very first film order!! I've been searching and searching for a lab [who] loves the same look I do, and I am so grateful to have found you! Have a terrific weekend—you've MADE mine! :slightly_smiling_face:  
__[Grace Willis of True Grace Photography](http://www.truegracephotography.com/) April 7, 2017__*

*I just wanted to say that, although I know I am not the only photographer you guys work with on a frequent basis, you guys always make me feel as if I were the only one . . . really valued and treasured. I know that is so rare, not just in this industry, but in this world! Thank you for that! Grateful for you guys, always!  
__[Nikki Santerre](http://www.nikkisanterre.com/) April 7, 2017__*

*I only started shooting film 3 months ago and this was only my fourth shoot since starting! I have been soaking in everything I can about learning to shoot film . . . and quite honestly, took some very good advice from Stephen Wood when I first got my camera. I listened very carefully to what he said and just ran with it! It was a very long phone call and I am forever grateful for the time he spent talking with me! Passion, drive and a great film lab will go a long way. :slightly_smiling_face: You guys rock! You guys really are so wonderful and the best decision I made was having you as my film lab! <code>&nbsp;</code>:heart: Just wish I didn't live on the other side of the country!!  
__[Sarah Murray Photography](http://www.smurrayphoto.com/) April 6, 2017__*

*I'm really blown away by how personal you get with each photographer and [how you] invest in us as much as we do in you. I couldn't be happier with switching film labs! XO!  
__[Kerry Langel of Kerry Jeanne Photography](http://www.kerryjeannephotography.com/) March 27, 2017__*

*PhotoVision Team, I just want to take a moment and let you guys know that when I received my film scans back (which was so fast!) I shed a tear. Or two. I can't tell you how amazed and in awe I was at the beautiful job you did. This was my true first session with film where I knew what I was doing and felt confident doing it. Any and all expectations I had of how my photos would turn out were shattered when I received my scans. The colors, the light, the exposure, skin tones, just PERFECT. Film has seriously transformed my love for photography and given me such a boost of confidence and desire to start my own business and be something I never thought I would call myself, a film photographer. Crazy!! I just want you guys to know that you're doing an amazing job and I can't wait to get my next batch of film to you guys!  
__[Hannah Haston of Hannah Grace Photography](http://www.hannahgracephoto.com) March 24, 2017__*

*I can never take for granted how generous, kind and educationally helpful the entire PhotoVision Team has been to me over the past 3 years. XOXO  
__[Matoli Keeley](http://www.matolikeelyphotography.com/) March 24, 2017__*

*You guys are AWESOME! This is why I am forever a loyal customer to the PV Team! . . . The pictures look great, thank you again sooooo much!!!! I truly appreciate it!  
__[Hannah Long-Browning](http://www.hannah-long.com/) March 21, 2017__*

*You guys are the GREATEST, truly the nicest to work with. Thanks so much for your guidance.  
__[Cristina Lozito](http://www.cristinalozito.com) March 16, 2017__*

*I just wanted to say that I absolutely ADORE these images! The colors, warmth, exposure, etc. were all completely spot on! . . . Thank you again for always making me so excited about scan day!  
__[Nikki Neswick of Nikki Nicole Photography](http://www.nikkineswick.com) March 16, 2017__*

*WOW!!!! You guys are phenomenal for getting these back so quickly!!!! Y’all made my day!!! Thank you!!  
__[Perry Vaile](http://www.perryvaile.com/) March 16, 2017__*

*Thank you for these beautiful scans!! It was my first time trying AgfaPhoto Vista and you made it shine! Thank you for your consistency and care toward every order.  
__[Violeta Garcia-Mendoza](http://www.violetagarciamendoza.com) March 15, 2017__*

*THE BEST film scan delivery of EVER!!! These are ridiculous!! Thank you guys as always! These are just incredible!  
__[Josie Derrick](http://www.josiederrick.com/) March 13, 2017__*

*You guys are amazing. We constantly feel incredibly supported, encouraged and loved on by y'all. We could not do what we do without your level expertise and service!!  
__[Jake & Heather Beerman](http://www.jakeandheatherphoto.com/) March 3, 2017__*

*I am just starting to shoot film again (after 15+ years) and am basically learning everything again. I called into the lab and talked to Stephen Wood today who was seriously the most helpful person. He took his time to go through everything with me and gave me so many helpful suggestions to get the look I want from my film. I felt a little silly making so many mistakes with my first venture back into film, but he made me feel so much better and hopeful that I can actually do this! Thank you so much! I am so happy to have found you guys.  
__[Sara Richardson](http://www.sararichardsonphoto.com/) March 2, 2017__*

*I simply fell in love with these images!!!! You did an amazing job!!! Massive thanks!!! :slightly_smiling_face: My mum loves them too! :slightly_smiling_face:  
__[Ashton Jean-Pierre](http://www.ashtonjean-pierre.com/) February 28, 2017__*

*THANK YOU! You guys made my day with your scans and unbelievably short turnaround time!! Your scans + colors are AMAZING, exactly how I like my work. You guys are the best!! I'm definitely back to film photography! :slightly_smiling_face:  
__[Sue Neuenschwander Fine Art Photography & Creative Direction](https://www.sueneuenschwander.com/) February 24, 2017__*

*Hi guys, thank you for the super fast turnaround time and amazing scans! Switching over to PV after 4 years with another lab was the best decision I've made with my business and has given me confidence to shoot more film. The edits are super consistent and it's easy for me to tell the images that I missed the exposure on instead of wondering about the scan quality. I just don't know how to say thank you enough.  
__[Laura Leslie](http://www.lauralesliephotography.com/) February 23, 2017__*

*Thank you SO much! You guys are amazing and I cannot wait to continue sending my film (and all of my friends) to you! I love your fast turnaround times and you developed these so perfectly! I will always treasure these (my first roll <code>&nbsp;</code>:heart:)!  
__[Rebecca Penny](http://www.rebeccapennyphotography.com/) February 22, 2017__*

*The more PhotoVision in my life, the better. You guys made my transition from digital a simplified dream . . . truly, and I’m forever grateful!  
__[Betsy Tomasello of Betsy Blue Photography](http://www.betsyblue.com/) February 22, 2017__*

*We really adore y’all and our photos have never looked better!  
__[Ashley + Coty Henry of Henry Photography](http://www.henryphotography.com/) February 15, 2017__*

*YOU GUYS, I love you all so much. These scans are so perfect. Please keep doing everything like this, this batch is PERFECTION! It’s so me, just what I was hoping for! . . . I’m just so thankful for how attentive you all are! I feel like even the slightest notes I had on contrast and highlight detail from my last scans were taken into consideration and everything is so perfect! I couldn’t be happier! Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  
__[Renée Tophia of Eden Willow Photography](http://www.edenwillowphoto.com/) February 15, 2017__*

*I just wanted to say THANK YOU to you guys for all of the perfect scans you've been sending me! Every order I have received is exactly what I was hoping for. You guys are amazing!

*Hi, PhotoVision Fam! I just wanted to say thank you so much for your incredible turnaround times right now. It has been amazing and I really appreciate all the work you do!  
__[Shayla Acosta of Shayla Renee Photography](http://www.shaylareneephotography.com/) February 2, 2017__*

*This was my first time using PhotoVision, and I have to say that I was incredibly happy with the colors and didn't do much tweaking or adjusting at all! I'm looking forward to working with PhotoVision as my regular film lab! :slightly_smiling_face:  
__[Faith Allen of Fallen Photography](http://www.thefallenphotography.com/) January 31, 2017__*

*Can't thank you guys enough for consistently setting the bar high with regards to film scanning! Not sure what I would do without you!  
__[Stan Kwan](http://www.stankwanphotos.com/) January 23, 2017__*
