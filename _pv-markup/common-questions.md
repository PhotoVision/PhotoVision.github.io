##  We're glad you're here. Let's get started:

## 1. [Create an account]({{ site.baseurl }}/create-account) 

## 2. [Submit preferences]({{ site.baseurl }}/preferences) 
Help us understand your overall vision. This will help speed up the process once we receive your film. [(Why is this important?)]({{site.baseurl}}/common-questions#what-are-preference-images--why-should-i-send-them-in){: id="preferences-link"}

## 3. Fill out an order form [online]({{ site.baseurl/order-work }}) or <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/images/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form.pdf" target="_blank">download + print</a> 
Order forms are *crucial*. They help ensure all your film has arrived safely and is processed to your specifications. If you submit an order form online, we will provide you with an order code. You must include this code with your film when shipping. This will ensure that your order information is attached to the correct film shipment. If you download + print an order form, no order code is needed.

## 4. [Safely]({{ site.baseurl }}/shipping-tips) ship your film + order code OR order form 
Learn how to [safely ship]({{ site.baseurl }}/shipping-tips) your precious cargo. Download our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/images/PhotoVision+Mailing+Label.pdf" target="_blank">pre-addressed shipping label</a> or hand-address your package in stunning calligraphy to:

## I’ve shipped my order. What happens next?
You’ll receive an email once we receive your order. This email includes your order number, the job's total cost and an invoice for your records. We will then process + scan your order as specified in your preferences + on your [online]({{ site.baseurl/order-work }}) or <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/images/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form.pdf" target="_blank">printed</a> order form.

## What are your turnaround times?
You can find our current film service time + print service time [here]({{ site.baseurl}}/service-times).

## Do you offer rush processing?
High-quality scans and speedy turnarounds are our jam! We are pleased to offer rush processing when our service times exceed a photographer's urgent time frame. See our [Rush Policy]({{ site.baseurl}}/rush-policy) for details.

## Will my scans be rotated and numbered?
Yes. Every scan arrives rotated and organized by roll number and frame number (i.e. XXXXX-xx.jpg) at no charge. [Ergo](http://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/ergo), if you number your rolls (which we *highly* recommend) your scans will be uploaded in chronological order. Pretty cool, huh?

## How do I receive my scans?
Once your scans are complete, you will receive an email to the address you provided when you created your account. This email includes a link to view and download your scans via <a href="http://box.com" target="_blank">Box</a>, a simple online file sharing system that keeps all your orders organized in your own folder free of charge. And, if you provide a shoot name on your [online]({{ site.baseurl/order-work }}) or <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/images/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form.pdf" target="_blank">printed</a> order form, your <a href="http://box.com" target="_blank">Box</a> order folder will be titled the same.

## Will my B+W scans arrive desaturated?
Yes. All black + white scans from both the Frontier and Noritsu arrive as fully desaturated RGB images, exhibiting truly neutral tones.

## What if I have a problem with my order?
If you have any questions or concerns at any time, please contact us as soon as possible via phone at [{{ site.company-info.display-phone }}](tel:{{ site.company-info.phone }}) or email at [{{ site.company-info.email }}](mailto:{{ site.company-info.email }}). We will do everything we can to ensure you are happy with your order!

## How do I order prints?
Proof prints may be requested via your [online]({{ site.baseurl/order-work }}) or <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/images/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form.pdf" target="_blank">printed</a> order form when you send in your film. Prefer to view your scans prior to ordering prints? Not a problem. You may <a href="http://photovision.dakisphotofactory.com/onlinePrint.html" target="_blank">order prints</a> from us anytime online from both film and digital. See [print pricing]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/print-services).

## How are my negatives handled?
We take the utmost care with your film! Negatives are carefully cut, sleeved and organized by hand at no charge. If your rolls are numbered (which we *highly* recommend) they will also be kept in numerical order.

## How do I get my negatives back?
We will hold your negatives based on the Ship Back preference marked on your [online]({{ site.baseurl/order-work }}) or <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/images/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form.pdf" target="_blank">printed</a> order form. Negatives are shipped back via USPS Priority Flat Rate shipping to reduce costs to you. We will charge your card on file at time of shipment. *For international shipping*, these prices will vary.

| **Ship Back Options** |   |

<h1 id="preferences-heading" class="accordion closed" title="Click to expand section">Preferences</h1>

<div class="panel" markdown="1">
Our world-class color techs can best match your vision when you provide the road map! And the best road maps include both preference images and written preferences.

## What are preference images + why should I send them in?

When scanning by hand, there are many color and density variations we can make within a single frame. Your preference images serve as style references so we can best match your scans to your creative vision.

We recommend sending in 3–5 preference images to keep on file. These images can be from your own portfolio or from another film photographer whom you admire.

When choosing preference images, the most important aspect to consider is skin tones. Pick images where your subject fills the majority of the frame and has the skin tones, density and contrast level you are striving to achieve.
  
## How do I submit them?
New customer? First, [create an account]({{ site.baseurl }}/create-account). Then, [submit your preference images]({{ site.baseurl }}/submit-preference-images). Current customers may [update preference images]({{ site.baseurl }}/submit-preference-images) or email them as an attachment to [{{ site.company-info.email }}](mailto:{{ site.company-info.email }}).

## What should I include under "Written Preferences?"

When it comes to skin tones, let your preference images speak to the tones you desire. Don't try to describe them here. Focus on describing your _overall ideal image_. 
- Warm / cool / neutral
- High contrast / medium contrast / low contrast
- Retain details in shadows / retain details in highlights
- _Avoid_ vague descriptions open to interpretation (i.e. "masculine," "romantic")

<h1 class="accordion closed" title="Click to expand section">Order specific preferences</h1>

<div class="panel" markdown="1">

## What if a specific order needs to look different from my standard vision?
Sometimes you have a client with special expectations, or take on a project that varies from your standard vision. We’re happy to use a specific set of  preferences for any given shoot. Simply submit them [here]({{site.baseurl}}/order-preferences), and specify which order/shoot name to use them for under “Shoot name.” 


## What if there are specific colors I’m looking for in my order?

It can be difficult for our scan techs to determine exact colors of certain objects—such as invitations, fabric, paint, etc. If you’re hoping to see those colors scanned as true as possible, please indicate what you expect to see in the Special Instructions section of your [online]({{ site.baseurl/order-work }}) or <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/images/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form-Dec-2017.pdf" target="_blank">printed</a> order form. Or, if possible, [submit digital preference images]({{site.baseurl}}/order-preferences) for the order illustrating the color(s) you want us to match, and specify which order/shoot name to use them for under “Shoot name.” 
</div>

Please keep in mind that in the winter months we typically run at a 1–2 business day service time. To ensure your order specific preferences are used please submit them *prior* to your film arriving in lab.

## What scanners do you use?
Every roll of film is scanned by hand on the renowned Fuji Frontier SP3000 or state-of-the-art Noritsu S-1800. Both are excellent tools to help you reach your vision. You may choose between either on your [online]({{ site.baseurl/order-work }}) or <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/images/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form-Dec-2017.pdf" target="_blank">printed</a> order form. Keep in mind, you may only choose *one scanner per order*. If you do not specify, we will scan your order on the Frontier. All black + white scans from either scanner arrive as fully desaturated RGB images, exhibiting truly neutral tones.

## How large are your scans?
Resolution matters. That's why our normal scans give you the freedom to print stunning 20x24s straight away, while our large scans can easily grace a billboard.

## Do you offer push/pull processing?
Yes, we can push film up to 2 stops or pull film 1 stop. Indicate on your [online]({{ site.baseurl/order-work }}) or <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/images/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form.pdf" target="_blank">printed</a> order form whether your film needs to be pushed or pulled and by how many stops (i.e. Push +2 or Pull -1). Also, please indicate which roll you need pushed or pulled by placing a *rubber band* around it. Push/pull processing is $3.00 per roll.

## How do you process Ilford Delta 3200?
We process Delta 3200 at 3200 unless you indicate otherwise. Please note on your [online]({{ site.baseurl/order-work }}) or <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/images/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form.pdf" target="_blank">printed</a> order form how you rated your 3200.

## Do you process + scan E-6 slide film?
Sadly, we no longer process E-6, but we do scan it.
</div>

<h1 class="accordion closed" title="Click to expand section">Exposure Reference Sheets</h1>

<div class="panel" markdown="1">

## What are they?
When shooting film, your negatives act as your road map to understanding the connection between how you expose your film and your scan results. Our goal is to provide a tool to help you better understand your exposures + your scans at a glance. [Exposure Reference Sheets]({{ site.baseurl }}/exposure-reference-sheet) provide a thumbnail of each frame, allowing you to clearly + easily see how you exposed your film. Pretty cool, huh?

## How do I read them?
Frames within your [Exposure Reference Sheets]({{ site.baseurl }}/exposure-reference-sheet) that appear dark represent underexposure, while frames that appear light represent overexposure. 

## Where do I find them?  

[Exposure Reference Sheets]({{ site.baseurl }}/exposure-reference-sheet) are provided for every roll in every job. They can be found within your order’s <a href="http://box.com" target="_blank">Box</a> folder.
