## Our world-class color techs can best match your vision when you provide reference images.


### What are reference images + why should I send them in?

 Your reference images serve as a style guide so we can best match your scans to your creative vision. We recommend sending in 3–5 reference images that best exemplify the skin tones, density and contrast level you are striving to achieve. These images can be from your own portfolio or from another film photographer whom you admire. 

### Is there a charge to set up or update my preferences?
Never. You can even set [order-specific preferences]({{site.baseurl}}/order-preferences) for free, too.  
  
### How do I submit reference images?
New customer? First [create an account]({{ site.baseurl }}/create-account), then [submit your reference images]({{ site.baseurl }}/preferences). Current customers may [update reference images]({{ site.baseurl }}/preferences), email them as an attachment to [{{ site.company-info.email }}](mailto:{{ site.company-info.email }}) or specify [order-specific preferences]({{site.baseurl}}/order-preferences).


### What are order-specific preferences?
Sometimes you have a shoot that differs from your standard vision. We’re happy to refer to a specific set of reference images for any given order, submit them [here]({{site.baseurl}}/order-preferences).

### What if there are specific colors I’m looking for in my scans?
Digital reference images can be very helpful when color matching film scans to certain objects such as invitations, fabric, paint, etc. If you need certain objects scanned as true as possible, please [submit digital reference images]({{site.baseurl}}/order-preferences) that show the object(s) and hue(s) you want us to match.

_To ensure your order-specific preferences are used, please submit them prior to your film arriving in lab._

### What are your turnaround times?
You can find our current film service time + print service time [here]({{ site.baseurl}}/service-times).

### Do you offer rush processing?
We are pleased to offer rush processing when our service times exceed a photographer's urgent time frame. See our [Rush Policy]({{ site.baseurl}}/rush-policy).

### Which scanners do you use?
Every roll of film is scanned by hand on the renowned Fuji Frontier SP3000 or our state-of-the-art Noritsu S-1800. Both are excellent tools to help you reach your vision. You may choose between either on your [online]({{ site.baseurl }}/order-work) or [printed]({{site.baseurl}}/images/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form.pdf){: target="_blank"} order form. *Keep in mind, you may only choose one scanner per order*.

### How do I receive my scans?
Once your scans are complete, we will send you an email with a link to view and download your scans via [Box](http://box.com){: target="_blank"}, a simple online file sharing system that keeps all your orders organized by session name in your own folder, free of charge.

### How large are your scans?
Resolution matters. That's why our normal scans give you the freedom to print stunning 20x24s straight away, while our large scans can easily grace a billboard.

All scans are created at 72 DPI, this is standard for both the Fuji Frontier SP3000 and the Noritsu S-1800. The number you want to keep an eye on is your scans' pixel dimensions provided in the chart below: 

#### Fuji Frontier SP3000

| **Film Size** | **Format** | **Normal Scan** | **Large Scan** |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **135** | 4×6 | 2400×3600 | 3600×5400 |
| **120 / 220** | 6×4.5 | 2700×3600 | 3600×4800 |
| **120 / 220** | 6×6 | 2700×2700 | 3600×3600 |
| **120 / 220** | 6×7 | 2700×3150 | 3600×4200 |
| **120 / 220** | 6×8 | 2700×3600 | 3600×4800 |
| **120 / 220** | 6×9 | 2700×4000 | 3600×5400 |
{: .tablelines}

#### Noritsu S-1800

| **Film Size** | **Format** | **Large Scan** |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **135** | 4×6 | 4400×6700 |
| **120 / 220** | 6×4.5 | 4800×3500 |
| **120 / 220** | 6×6 | 4800×4700 |
| **120 / 220** | 6×7 | 4800×5900 |
| **120 / 220** | 6×8 | 4900×6600 |
| **120 / 220** | 6×9 | 4900×7100 |
{: .tablelines}
*All scan resolutions are approximate. Slight variations are normal. All scans can be easily re-sampled to 300 DPI in LightRoom or Photoshop.*

### Will my scans be rotated + numbered?
Yes. Every scan arrives rotated and organized by roll number and frame number (i.e. XXXXX-xx.jpg) at no charge. Pro tip: if you number your rolls (which we *highly* recommend) your scans will be uploaded in chronological order, streamlining your post work. 

### Will my black + white scans arrive desaturated?
Yes. All black + white scans from both the Frontier and Noritsu arrive as fully desaturated RGB images, exhibiting truly neutral tones.

### Do you offer push/pull processing?
Yes, we can push film up to 2 stops or pull film 1 stop. Indicate on your [online]({{ site.baseurl }}/order-work) or [printed]({{site.baseurl}}/images/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form.pdf){: target="_blank"} order form whether your film needs to be pushed or pulled and by how many stops (i.e. Push +2 or Pull -1). Also, please indicate which roll you need pushed or pulled by placing a *rubber band* around it. Push/pull processing is an additional $3.00 per roll.

### How do you process Ilford Delta 3200?
We process Delta 3200 at 3200 unless you indicate otherwise. Please note on your [online]({{ site.baseurl }}/order-work) or [printed]({{site.baseurl}}/images/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form.pdf){: target="_blank"} order form how you rated this film.

### Do you process + scan E-6 slide film?
We no longer process E-6, but we do scan it.

### Are your prints true photographic prints?
Yes. Since 1968, we've respected the art of the print. Our true, wet process photographs pay homage to traditional darkroom printing. You love your scans—why trust another lab with your prints?

### What papers do you offer?
We use only the finest Fujicolor Crystal Archive papers. These aren't your typical photo papers—they have a luscious thickness you have to see (and feel) to believe.
