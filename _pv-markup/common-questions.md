# The Experience

## What are preference images + why should I send them in?

When scanning by hand, there are many color and density variations we can make within a single frame. Your preference images serve as style references so we might best match your scans to your **creative vision**.

We recommend you send us **3-5 preference images** to keep on file. These images can be from your own film portfolio or from another film photographer whom you admire.

When choosing preference images, the most important aspect to consider is **skin tones**. Pick images where your subject fills the majority of the frame and has the **skin tones**, **density** and **contrast level** you are striving to achieve.

## How do I update/change my preference images?
**New customer?** First, [create an account](https://photovisionprints.squarespace.com/create-account). *Then*, [submit your preference images](https://photovisionprints.squarespace.com/submit-preference-images).
**Current customers** may update preference images [here](https://photovisionprints.squarespace.com/submit-preference-images) or email them as an attachment to [info@photovisionprints.com](mailto:info@photovisionprints.com).

## Who do you recommend for shipping?
We *highly recommend* shipping your film *in a box* via a *trackable service* to ensure your film arrives safely. Generally, we have found USPS Priority Mail to be the most economical choice. Learn how to [safely ship](https://photovisionprints.squarespace.com/shipping-tips) your precious cargo.

## How do I know my film has arrived?
Once your film arrives in lab, you will receive a confirmation email at the address provided on your [order form](http://photovisionprints.com/s/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form-Fall-2015.pdf). This email includes your order number and the job's total cost.

## How do I receive my scans?
Once your scans are complete, you will receive an email to the address provided on your [order form](https://photovisionprints.squarespace.com/s/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form-Fall-2015.pdf). This email includes a link to view and download your images via [Box](http://box.com), a simple online file sharing system that keeps all your orders organized. Your [Box](http://box.com) folder is provided free of charge. And, if you provide a job reference name on your [order form](https://photovisionprints.squarespace.com/s/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form-Fall-2015.pdf), your [Box](http://box.com) order folder will be titled the same! Talk about orginization! 

## Will my scans be rotated and numbered?
Yes! Every scan arrives rotated and organized by roll number and frame number (i.e. XXXXX-xx.jpg) at *no charge*. So, if you number your rolls (which BTW, we *highly* recommend) your scans will be uploaded in chronological order. Pretty cool, huh?

## What if I have a problem with my order?
If you have any questions, concerns or difficulties at any time, please contact us as soon as possible via email at [info@photovisionprints.com](mailto:info@photovisionprints.com) or by phone at 503-588-3686. We will do everything we can to ensure you are happy with your order!


## How do I order prints?
Proof prints can be requested via your [order form](http://photovisionprints.com/s/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form-Fall-2015.pdf) when you send in your film. Prefer to view your scans prior to ordering prints? Not a problem! You may [order prints](http://photovisionprints.com/ordering/) from us anytime online from film or digital images. Find print pricing [here](http://photovisionprints.com/print).

## How do I get my negatives back?
We will hold your negatives based on the Ship Back preference marked on your [Order Form](http://photovisionprints.com/s/PhotoVision-Film-Order-Form-Fall-2015.pdf).

| **Ship Back Options** |   |
| --- | :---: |
| **2 weeks** | $6.50 |
| **Fill 2" Flat Rate box** | $10.00 |
| **Fill 4" Flat Rate box** | $20.00 |


Negatives are shipped back via USPS Priority Flat Rate shipping to reduce costs to you. We will charge your card on file at time of shipment. *For international shipping*, these prices will vary.

## How are my negatives handled + organized?
We take the utmost care with your film! Negatives will be carefully cut, sleeved and organized at no charge. If your rolls are numbered (which BTW, we *highly* recommend) they will also be kept in numerical order.

## How large are your scans?
Resolution matters. That's why our normal scans give you the freedom to print stunning 20x24s straight away, while our large scans can easily grace a billboard.

| **Film Size** | **Format** | **Normal Scan** | **Large Scan** |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **35mm** | 4x6 | 2400x3600 | 3600x5400 |
| **120 / 220** | 6x4.5 | 2700x3600 | 3600x4800 |
| **120 / 220** | 6x6 | 2700x2700 | 3600x3600 |
| **120 / 220** | 6x7 | 2700x3150 | 3600x4200 |
| **120 / 220** | 6x8 | 2700x3600 | 3600x4800 |
*All scan resolutions are approximate. Slight variations are normal.*

## What scanner do you use?
Every roll of film is scanned by hand on the renowned Fuji Frontier SP3000. We've had experience with many film scanners through the years, but nothing comes close to the image quality and control of the Frontier SP3000.

## What are Exposure Reference Sheets?
When shooting film, your negatives act as your road map to understanding the connection between how you expose your film and your scan results. Exposure Reference Sheets are provided for every roll within your order's [Box](http://box.com) folder. They are designed to help you better understand the relationship between your exposures and scans at a glance.


## How do I read my Exposure Reference Sheets?
Exposure Reference Sheets provide a thumbnail of every frame in your roll, allowing you to clearly and easily see how you exposed your film. Frames that are light with little detail represent overexposure, while frames that are dark with lots of detail represent underexposure. [See examples](https://photovisionprints.squarespace.com/exposure-reference-sheet).

## Do you offer push/pull processing?
Yes, we can push or pull film up to 3 stops. Indicate on your order form whether your film needs to be pushed or pulled and by how many stops (i.e. Push +2 or Pull -1). Also, please indicate which roll you need pushed or pulled by placing a **rubber band** around it. Push/pull processing is $3.00 per roll.

## How do you process Ilford Delta 3200?
We process Delta 3200 at 3200 unless you indicate otherwise. So, let us know what you rate your 3200 at, please and thank you.


## Do you process + scan E-6 slide film?
Sadly, we no longer process E-6. But we do scan it!
