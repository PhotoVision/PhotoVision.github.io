Strong âœ– Soft. Beautiful #filmportrait by [@loragradyphotography](http://www.loragradyphotography.com/). "My inspiration behind this shoot was to photograph beautiful portraits replicating the emotion + anticipation of a bride getting married on her wedding day. I often times feel like portraits can easily become stiff, so I wanted to stretch myself creatively on this whole shoot. I love how striking and confident, yet calm, Katie is so I wanted to capture the strong + soft beauty with total eye contact. My best photography advice is to never stop observing, never stop creating. There are so many ways to tell a story and I love challenging myself to tell stories in different ways not only with my clients, but with my personal work as well. My favorite thing about this image is the eye contact of this beautiful human! It's like she's just looking right into my soul haha!" â€” [Lora Grady](http://www.loragradyphotography.com/)
