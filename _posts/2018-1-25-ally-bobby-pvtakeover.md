Hi, friends! We‚Äôre [@allyandbobby](http://allyandbobby.com/) and we are SO excited to be hosting a [#pvtakeover](http://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/allyandbobbysvision/) this week!! We are humbled and honored to be chosen to share some of our all-time favorite images and advice about being film photographers. 

People often ask us about our story‚ÄîWho started shooting first? How did you get into film? Is this your full-time job or your side hustle? So we thought we would answer a few of those questions for you here!

Ally majored in photography in college and this is where her love for #film truly began. She spent hours in the darkroom every week developing her rolls and printing them on enlargers. Being able to be so hands-on with the film development process back then helps us immensely with our medium format work today. We met in college‚Äîactually because of one of Ally‚Äôs photography projects! She needed a model for a short film she was creating and asked her then acquaintance‚Äîme, Bobby‚Äîto be her subject. As they say, the rest was history! Ally taught me everything she knew about photography and the first wedding we ever shot we did together. Our photography business is our full-time job and we are so grateful to work together every single day doing something we both love so much! 

We would love to hear from you!! Interacting with y‚Äôall is the best part of sharing!

[@allyandbobby](http://allyandbobby.com/) [#pvtakeover](http://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/allyandbobbysvision/) Day 1 // Often as photographers we struggle with comparing our work to others. We all tend to be our own worst critics and that can destroy creativity as well as our work itself. Choosing to chase others‚Äô aesthetics will always lead to a distorted version of your own vision. We always try to give ourselves grace when we look at our work! Whether we slightly missed focus or could have chosen a better background, there is always something to improve on. Focusing on the negative tends to make photographers shoot ‚Äúscared.‚Äù Scared to make a mistake rather than excited to make a moment. Bring grace into your work and take risks to capture beautiful photographs.

[@allyandbobby](http://allyandbobby.com/) [#pvtakeover](http://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/allyandbobbysvision/) Day 1 // When you‚Äôre first starting out, it can seem like there are infinite variables to achieve your specific aesthetic. One of the biggest factors is the #filmlab you choose to work with. Finding a lab who can consistently nail scans every single time is difficult! We value consistency in our scans and customer service above all else when choosing a lab to work with. That‚Äôs why our decision to go with [#PhotoVision](http://photovisionprints.com) was so easy! Time after time, they deliver magic to our inbox, and if we ever have any issues or questions, their customer service is second to none! They love film and value it like we do and we believe that comes through in their end product.

[@allyandbobby](http://allyandbobby.com/) [#pvtakeover](http://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/allyandbobbysvision/) Day 2 // We feel really blessed to work together as a husband + wife team! Sometimes when people learn we work together, they say, ‚ÄúI could never work with my spouse!‚Äù We know it‚Äôs not for everyone! But we do believe having well-defined roles within our business has set us up for success. Whether you work with your spouse or have an intern or a full team, being clear with all members of your business on what their roles are helps prevent confusion, keeps things moving smoothly and maximizes efficiency.

[@allyandbobby](http://allyandbobby.com/) [#pvtakeover](http://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/allyandbobbysvision/) Day 2 // Maintaining a grateful heart is paramount when shooting weddings. It is always an honor to be involved in one of the biggest days of someones life. We are grateful for every single client who has been in front of our cameras! The wedding day is never about us‚Äîit‚Äôs always about the client and preserving their memories. When you approach situations with gratitude, it transforms your client‚Äôs experience.

[@allyandbobby](http://allyandbobby.com/) [#pvtakeover](http://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/allyandbobbysvision/) Day 3 // We always remind our brides that other than your rings, your photos will be the only tangible thing that remains after your wedding day. The moments we capture on a wedding day are important. We know one day our photos will be displayed long after we‚Äôre gone and they will be how people's parents, grandparents and loved ones are remembered forever. We do not take this responsibility lightly! It is our goal to help preserve the legacy of our clients in images that will be passed down throughout generations.

[@allyandbobby](http://allyandbobby.com/) [#pvtakeover](http://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/allyandbobbysvision/) Day 3 // The best part of our job is hearing from our bride and grooms after they receive their wedding photos. Nothing makes us happier than hearing how much they love them! When we hear that our photos made them laugh, cry and that they‚Äôre better than they could have imagined, it makes all our hard work shooting and editing totally worth it. We‚Äôre sure you‚Äôve heard some great praise from your clients, too! Whether you have one amazing email or 100, consider taking the time today to make them easily accessible. Print them out. Put them all in a folder on your desktop. Put them in a place where you can re-read them because, let‚Äôs face it‚Äîbeing a small business owner is extremely hard work. We could all use a pick up every now and then, and these wonderful notes we receive from our clients do it for us every time!

[@allyandbobby](http://allyandbobby.com/) [#pvtakeover](http://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/allyandbobbysvision/) Day 3 // Thank you so much for following along with us this week! We would love to hear from you if you have any questions about an image or something we mentioned this week or about anything at all! We want to be open books when it comes to our business, and we offer mentor sessions to be able to dive into all things photography with you 1:1. If we didn‚Äôt have mentors who poured into us at the beginning of our journey with their knowledge, we would 100% not be where we are today. We still ask questions of people who have gone before us because we can always learn more! We cannot overstate the importance of a mentor in your life! From metering preferences to how to run your social media account, a mentor can help you avoid the pitfalls they experienced in their career. We strongly believe it is one of the best ways to invest into your business.

We are also immensely grateful to our amazing film lab, [#PhotoVision](http://photovisionprints.com)!! They are always available to help with a question about anything, to walk through your scans with you and they truly have the best customer service around. Can we just all agree they are the best?! To us, they are a huge part of our team and we want to thank them again for asking us to take over their account this week!
