Chasing light to get the shot üëåüèΩ with [@laurelleplusdale](http://www.laurelleplusdale.com/) on #kodakfilm! David Laurelle + Kylee Dale work as a husband/wife photography team, capturing couples on and before their wedding day. "This engagement shoot was especially touching since this couple happens to be two of our best friends. You could feel the love between them. Their enthusiasm for life and each other was so apparent in every shot, from twirling over icy ponds to hiking through the Rocky Mountains. During the shoot, we were rushing from spot to spot to to make sure we had enough time before the sun went down. This was the last location of the day, and with the sun just peeking out from behind the #RockyMountains, the lighting could not have been more perfect. Our advice as photographers is to always #chasethelight, since perfect lighting makes for the best images!" ‚Äî [Laurelle + Dale Photography](http://www.laurelleplusdale.com/)
