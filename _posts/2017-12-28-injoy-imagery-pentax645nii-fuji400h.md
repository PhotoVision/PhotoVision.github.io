Film can capture beauty absolutely anywhere! Film newbie [@injoyimagery](http://www.injoyimagery.com/) shares her heart and vision below: 

"I'm incredibly new to film and this was probably the 10th roll I ever shot. One of my dear friends is a former model, so I kidnapped her one evening and we shot a few rolls in beautiful Cherokee Park. I still hadn't had my fix and the light was only getting prettier but I knew I needed some open fields in my life. The best and first field we found was a bean field on a major highway right next to a fire hall. I had her crouch down to get a nice soft backdrop and to avoid any distractions. Just goes to show, if you pick the right angles and the light is right, film can capture beauty absolutely anywhere.

Starting my #filmjourney has been equal parts scary + exciting. I went to the [@kaylabarkerphoto](http://www.kaylabarker.com/) workshop this summer in Normandy, before even purchasing my film camera. I knew I was incredibly drawn to the look of film and going to the workshop solidified my decision and encouraged me to finally take the leap. When I got back, I bought a #Pentax 645NII. I feel like I've fallen in love so quicklyâ€”from loading film, to the noises my camera makes to shipping off my film (scary, but you just have to trust the process!) and then there's scan day, AKA #filmphotographer's Christmas morning. I had very low expectations for my first 13 rolls I sent off, but I couldn't believe some of the images I captured. I won't lie, the bad ones were realllll bad lol but the good ones? I couldn't believe were my work! The way they look straight from [#PhotoVision](http://photovisionprints.com/film) is insaneâ€”the colors, the contrast and that creamy softness are total perfection. I'm so excited to continue this journey and gain confidence and I can't wait for my 2nd scan day." â€” [Jacqueline Hofing of Injoy Imagery](http://www.injoyimagery.com/)
