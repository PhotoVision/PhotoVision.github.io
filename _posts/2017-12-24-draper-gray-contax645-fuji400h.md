'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the land, cameras loaded with film were clutched tightly in hand! 🎅🏼🎞👦🏼 Photo by [@drapergray](https://www.drapergray.com/). "My nephew's grandparents have #Santa come to their historic farm for photos and time with their grandchildren each year. This year, I was there to try to capture some of these moments #onfilm. Photographing children on film—especially rambunctious toddlers—can be so difficult! Knowing how they often like to do anything but look at the camera or smile, I opted to catch candid moments rather than posed. This photo was a sweet moment between Santa and my nephew and, coincidentally, the biggest smile we got from him while the camera was out! I always aim to find emotion in my frame. When looking through the lens, I seek out the frame that makes me feel something before pressing the shutter button. It may not always fall in line with what is 'perfect' in terms of technical precision—however, if it makes me feel a little spark in the moment, I find that it most often translates onto film." — [Draper Gray](https://www.drapergray.com/)
