#SundayFunday with the fam! Photo by [@emilyannhughes_](http://www.emilyannhughes.com/){: target="_blank"}. "I love for my clients to feel as comfortable as possible in front of my camera. I give them guidance with poses, while also encouraging them to talk and play. This shot is such a good reminder for me to let them do exactly that. This sweet little girl was getting a little tired and I had them in a pose to smile at the camera. Her mom took a break to sing her 'Pat-a-Cake,' and it ended being one of my favorite shots from the session!" â€” Emily Ann Hughes
