#squadgoals on #fujifilm! âœ¨ðŸŽžâœ¨ Photo by [@sarahwindecker](http://www.sarahwindeckerphotography.com/){: target="_blank"}. "Taylor the bride grew up riding horses at Oak Tree Farms, and it was her dream as a little girl to get married underneath the beautiful large oak trees on the property. That dream finally came true for her. I really wanted to capture the essence of the location, so I was intentional about taking as many pictures with the oak trees and horses as possible to help capture the venue that meant so much to her." â€” [Sarah Windecker](http://www.sarahwindeckerphotography.com/){: target="_blank"}
